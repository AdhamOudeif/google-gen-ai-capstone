## 🌟 Features

- 🧠 Uses Google's Gemini (`google-genai`) model
- 💬 Generates next video ideas based on YouTube comments
- 🔁 Retry logic built-in for API rate limits
- 🔐 Clean API key handling with `.env` support
- ⚡ Easy to run from the command line

---

## 🚀 Process Overview

### 1. 🔹 Input

**User Input:**
- A YouTube video URL.
- (Optional) A query prompt (e.g., "Looking for video ideas around AI trends and future tech").

---

### 2. 🔄 Stages

#### 🧩 Stage 1: Scraping YouTube Comments

**Description:**
- Fetches top-level comments from the specified YouTube video using the YouTube Data API.

**Console Output:**
- Logs the raw comments scraped from the video.

**Key Function:** fetch_comments

---

#### 🧹 Stage 2: Processing Comments

**Description:**
Cleans the raw comments by:
- Removing duplicates
- Stripping emojis
- Filtering out non-English comments
- Removing very short comments (less than 5 characters)

**Console Output:**
- Logs the raw comments before processing
- Logs the cleaned comments after processing

**Key Function:** preprocess_comments

---

#### 🧠 Stage 3: Vectorization / Embeddings

**Description:**
- Converts cleaned comments into numerical embeddings using Gemini embeddings.
- Computes cosine similarity between the optional query and comment embeddings.
- Extracts the top 5 most relevant comments.

**Console Output:**
- Logs embeddings (partially, for readability)
- Logs top 5 comments and their similarity scores

**Key Functions:** embed_all_comments, get_top_k_similar_comments

---

#### 🎬 Stage 4: Video Idea Generation

**Description:**
- Passes the top 5 comments (or all if no query provided) to a chatbot agent.
- The chatbot generates creative and engaging video ideas based on those comments.

**Console Output:**
- Logs the input comments sent to the chatbot
- Logs the generated video ideas

**Key Function:** chatbot

---

### 3. ✅ Output

**Final Output:**
- A list of video ideas generated by the chatbot.

**Intermediate Debug Logs:**
- Top comments
- Embedding vectors
- Similarity scores
- Full chatbot response

---

## ⚙️ Execution Flow

### Graph Initialization

A StateGraph defines the pipeline:
get_video_comments → chatbot

### Graph Invocation

- The graph is invoked with the video_url and optional query.
- Each node processes and passes enriched state forward.
- Final chatbot response is returned to the user.

---

## 📌 Example

Here’s an example of what the pipeline outputs:

Input Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6OYPeQtW8o  
Comments:
- "That's a heck of a thread,... great job kaggle!"
- "Great feature! Amazing work from the Kaggle team"
- "Great personality"
- "Kaggle team please provide easy way to create yaml file for thousand or more images datasets."
